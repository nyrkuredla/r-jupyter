# r-notes
Decided to start a new repo along with learning R Markdown. The notion here is to review the coursework I just finished (June 2021) at the University of Washington and expand on what I learned about R, data analytics, data visualization, etc. so that I don't forget everything I did over the past 6 months by the time I come back around to taking the next class.
